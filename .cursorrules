# Anthropic Quickstarts - Computer Use Demo

## Repository Overview
This repository contains quickstart projects for building applications with Anthropic's Claude. The main focus is on the **Computer Use Demo**, which demonstrates how Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet models can control a desktop computer.

## Project Structure
The primary directory we're working with is `computer-use-demo/`, which contains:
- `terraform/`: Infrastructure as Code for deploying the demo on AWS EC2
- Docker configuration for running the demo in a containerized environment

## Terraform Deployment

The `computer-use-demo/terraform/` directory contains a complete Terraform configuration for deploying Claude Computer Use Demo on AWS EC2. This allows you to run the demo in the cloud rather than locally.

### Key Commands

```bash
# Navigate to the terraform directory
cd computer-use-demo/terraform

# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Preview changes before applying
terraform plan

# Deploy the infrastructure
terraform apply

# Connect to the instance (replace with your actual IP)
# IMPORTANT: Create SSH tunnel for ALL required services (RECOMMENDED METHOD)
ssh -i ~/.ssh/claude_aws_key -L 8080:127.0.0.1:8080 -L 6080:127.0.0.1:6080 -L 5900:127.0.0.1:5900 -L 8501:127.0.0.1:8501 -N ubuntu@<instance_public_ip>

# Simple tunnel (NOT RECOMMENDED - interface may not work properly)
# ssh -L 8080:127.0.0.1:8080 -i ~/.ssh/claude_aws_key ubuntu@<instance_public_ip>

# Access the Claude interface
# Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser

# When finished, destroy all resources
terraform destroy
```

This tunneling command forwards all necessary ports:
- 8080: Main Claude interface
- 6080: noVNC web interface
- 5900: VNC direct connection
- 8501: Streamlit interface

The `-N` flag prevents opening a shell and is useful for just forwarding ports.

### Resource Requirements

- EC2 instance type: At least t3.2xlarge recommended (t3.large may be insufficient)
- The deployment includes VPC, security groups, and other necessary network components
- Estimated cost: ~$240-300/month (t3.2xlarge running 24/7) or ~$80-100/month with scheduled stops

## Computer Use Demo Overview

The Computer Use Demo provides an environment where Claude can:
- Control a virtual desktop running in a Docker container
- Access web browsers and other applications
- Interact with a graphical interface
- Execute commands

The Terraform deployment automatically sets up:
- EC2 instance with Ubuntu 22.04
- Docker installation
- Container configuration with appropriate ports (8080, 8501, 6080, 5900)
- Systemd service for auto-starting the container
- API key configuration for Claude 

## Additional Options

### Enable Thinking Mode

You can enable "Thinking" mode by setting the `ENABLE_THINKING` environment variable to `true`:

```bash
# For local Docker execution
docker run \
    -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY \
    -e ENABLE_THINKING=true \
    -v $HOME/.anthropic:/home/computeruse/.anthropic \
    -p 5900:5900 \
    -p 8501:8501 \
    -p 6080:6080 \
    -p 8080:8080 \
    -it ghcr.io/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts:computer-use-demo-latest
```

The Terraform deployment already includes this flag.
